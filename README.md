Randomizer - Alexa
==================

This is an Alexa Skill that I made for practice, on a whim. I was almost done when I realized that I had not bothered to check if Alexa comes with this functionality built in. Turns out, she does. I had spent a couple hours on it, so I decided to publish it on GitHub anyway, hoping it can act as reference material for somebody down the road.

The speech interactions may be a little rough around the edges because I am not going to submit it to the Skills store. I intended to add some more personality to the Skill, but never did.

If you have any questions about this Skill or developing for Alexa, tweet to me [@Antrikshy](http://twitter.com/Antrikshy).
